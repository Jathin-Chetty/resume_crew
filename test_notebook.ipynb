        "\n",
        "**Problem**: Job applications are complex, multi-step processes requiring specialized expertise across different domains. Candidates must research job requirements, compile comprehensive profiles, tailor resumes to specific roles, and prepare for interviews - each requiring different skills and knowledge that most job seekers lack.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why AI Agents**: AI agents can process large amounts of information from multiple sources (job postings, GitHub profiles, personal data), apply specialized knowledge consistently, and provide personalized recommendations at scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-Agent Value**: Instead of one agent trying to handle everything, we use specialized agents that work together:\n",
        "- Each agent focuses on their expertise area with specific tools\n",
        "- Agents can process different data sources simultaneously  \n",
        "- Collaborative workflow ensures each step builds on the previous one\n",
        "- Context sharing between agents creates comprehensive, personalized results\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution**: A CrewAI-based system with 4 specialized agents that work together to optimize the entire job application process:\n",
        "- **Tech Job Researcher**: Scrapes and analyzes job postings to extract key requirements, skills, and qualifications\n",
        "- **Personal Profiler**: Compiles comprehensive candidate profiles from GitHub repositories and personal information\n",
        "- **Resume Strategist**: Tailors resumes to highlight relevant skills and experiences that match job requirements\n",
        "- **Interview Preparer**: Creates targeted interview questions and talking points based on the tailored resume and job requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tools Used**: SerperDev (web search), ScrapeWebsite (job posting analysis), FileRead (resume processing), MDXSearch (semantic search of candidate data)\n"
